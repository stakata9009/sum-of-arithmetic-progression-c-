# sum-of-arithmetic-progression-c-sharp
This C# program is able to calculate the sum of an Arithmetic Progression using for loop

The formula for finding the sum of an AP is Sn = ((a1 + an)/2)*n
Where:
a1 is the first element;
an is the last element;
n is the number of elements;
d is the difference between elements.

The program is set in way that allows the user to input all the necessary information (a1, d and n) with which is able to calculate everything else.

Finding an is done using the formula an = a1 + (n-1) * d;

The program is using a for loop to generate every item in the progression and it looks like this:
for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
